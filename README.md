# Todo CLI

Welcome to the Todo Command Line Interface! This tool helps you manage your daily tasks directly from your
terminal.

## Quick Start

To get the tool up and running quickly, please note that it is currently hosted on [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/)
and not on the regular [PyPI](https://pypi.org/). This means the installation command differs from the typical method:

```shell
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple todo-cli-vh
```

This command installs the latest version of `todo-cli-vh` from TestPyPI, while also allowing dependencies to be resolved
from the official PyPI index.

Once installed, you can begin using the `todo` command in your terminal to manage your tasks.
